Normal distribution is characterised by mean $$\mu$$ and standard deviation $$\sigma$$  

<img src="../../assets/images/normal-distribution/normal.png"/>

No matter what $$\mu$$ and standard deviation $$\sigma$$  is,  
* the area between $$\mu + \sigma$$  and $$\mu - \sigma$$ is 68%  

*  the area between $$\mu + 2\sigma$$  and $$\mu - 2\sigma$$ is 95%  

*  the area between $$\mu + 3\sigma$$  and $$\mu - 3\sigma$$ is 97%   

## Standard Normal Distribution  

The standard normal distribution is characterised by $$\mu$$ of **0** and $$\sigma$$ is **1**.  

All normal distributions can be converted into standard normal distribution by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation.  

Z = (X - $$\mu$$) / $$\sigma$$

## Birth Weights example

</div>

If Birth weights in a population are normally distributed with a mean of 109 oz and a standard deviation of 13 oz,

### Question

What is the chance of having birth weights of **141 oz and higher**  when sampling birth records at random ?  

### Solution

Z score of 141 = ( 141 - 109)/13 = 2.46

Probability of the weight 141 and lower corresponding to Z score of 2.46 is 0.99305

Probability of the weight 141 and higher 1- 0.99305=.00695 
which is 0.695%  

### Question

What is the chance of having birth weights of **120 oz and lighter**  when sampling birth records at random ?  

### Solution

Z score of 120 = ( 120 - 109)/13 = 0.846153846

Probability of the weight 120 and lower corresponding to Z score of 0.846153846 is 0.79955  which is around 79.95%

## SAT score example  

For example if we wanted to know the math score that corresponded to the 90th percentile ( assuming a mean score of 500 and standard deviation of 50) ?

In the Z table we would find the Z score corressponding to the probability of 0.9 which would be 1.28.

Z = (X - $$\mu$$) / $$\sigma$$  

1.28 = (X - 500)/50

Therefore X = 500 + 50*1.28 = 500 + 64 = 564
