description: Central Limit Theorem

---   

Population data has a mean of $$\mu$$ and standard deviation $$\sigma$$.  
Sample data has a mean of $$\bar x$$ and standard deviation of **s**.  

What is the average starting salary of all computer science  students who finished their engineering last year in Karnataka, a state in India which has a lot of engineering colleges? 

## Population  

all computer science  students who finished their engineering last year in Karnataka.  

Mean salary = $$\mu$$ and Standard deviation salary  = $$\sigma$$  

## Sample

sample of all computer science  students who finished their engineering last year in Karnataka.  

Mean salary = $$\bar x$$ and Standard deviation salary  = **s**  

## Central Limit Theorem  

Consider a random sample of n observations from a  population with mean $$\mu$$ and standard deviation $$\sigma$$.  

Let $$\bar x$$ be the sample mean. The **distribution** of $$\bar x$$ is approximately **Normal** with mean = $$\mu$$ and standard deviation **s** = $$\sigma$$ / $$\sqrt{n}$$  

### Example  

all computer science  students who finished their engineering last year in Karnataka.  

Mean salary = $$\mu$$ = INR 500,000 and Standard deviation salary  = $$\sigma$$  = INR 20,000  

<hr/>

We survey a sample of 50 students and below is their salary.  

<hr/>

Sample 1 Mean Salary = INR 490,000 and Standard deviation salary  = s = INR 10,000  

Sample 2 Mean Salary = INR 510,000 and Standard deviation salary  = s  = INR 18,000  

Sample 3 Mean Salary = INR 480,000 and Standard deviation salary  = s  = INR 15,000  

Sample 4 Mean Salary = INR 520,000 and Standard deviation salary  = s  = INR 20,000  

<hr/>

The sample salary follows a normal distribution  with mean = $$\bar x$$ = $$\mu$$ = INR 500,000 and standard deviation **s** = $$\sigma$$ / $$\sqrt{n}$$  = INR 20,000/$$\sqrt{50}$$ since the number of students in each sample is 50.
