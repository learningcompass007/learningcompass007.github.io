The WTA (Women's Tennis Association) is the principal organizing body of women's professional tennis, it governs its own tour worldwide. On its website, it provides a lot of data about the players as individuals as well the tour matches with results and the current rank during it.          

The Kaggle Dataset found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/joaoevangelista/wta-matches-and-rankings) covers statistics of players registered on the WTA (Womens Tennis Association), the matches that happened on each tour by year, with results, as well some qualifying matches for the tours
