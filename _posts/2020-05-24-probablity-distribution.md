Probability distribution is also known as Probability function.  

* This gives the probabilities of all possible outcomes  
* A  mathematical function which maps each possible outcome x to the probability p(x)  
* The probabilities must all sum or integrate to 1  

## Discrete and Continous Probability distribution

Discrete probability functions can take only discrete values. Examples include Dead/ Alive , numbers obtained by rolling a die, treatment / placebo, whole numbers  

Continuous probability functions can take any value within a range. Examples include blood pressure,weight,the speed of a car.  
 

## Probablity mass function  

is a function that gives the probability of a **discrete random variable** which is exactly equal to some value. The following table shows the probablity mass function of roll of a die

        <td>6</td>

# Cumulative distribution function

is a function that gives the probability of a **random variable** is within some range. The following table shows the cumulative distribution function of roll of a die  

<table class="table">
  <thead class="thead-dark">
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">#</th>
      <th scope="col">x</th>
      <th scope="col">p(x<=A)</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">1</th>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>p(x<=1) = 1/6</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">2</th>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>p(x<=2) = 2/6</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">3</th>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>p(x<=3) = 3/6</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">4</th>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>p(x<=4) = 4/6</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">5</th>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>p(x<=5) = 5/6</td>
    </tr>
     <tr>
      <th scope="row">6</th>
        <td>6</td>
        <td>p(x<=6) = 6/6</td>
    </tr>
