---   

A t-distribution is like a standard normal (Z) distribution, except it has slightly fatter tails for small samples (n<100).
The bigger the sample size, then closer the t becomes to Z. if nâ‰¥100, t approaches Z.  

* It is a symmetric distribution centered around zero.  
* Has a single parameter called the **degrees of freedom or df.**  

### Degrees of Freedom  

* linked to size of data being used  

* larger set of data would have greater degrees of freedom  

* as degrees of freedom increase the t-distribution becomes closer and closer to the standard normal distribution
