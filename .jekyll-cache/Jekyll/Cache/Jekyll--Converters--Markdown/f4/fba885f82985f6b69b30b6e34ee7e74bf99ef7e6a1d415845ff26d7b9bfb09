I"s<p>We explain Confidence Interval calculation for a population proportion with the help of an example.</p>

<h2 id="quality-control-safety-devices">Quality Control safety devices</h2>

<p>A machine produces safety devices for use in helicopters. A quality control engineer regularly checks samples of the devices produced by the machine, and if too many devices are defective the production process is stopped and the machine is reaadjusted.If a random sample of 52 devices yeilds 8 defectives, give a 98% confidence interval for the proportion of defective devices made by the machine.</p>

<p><strong>Probability outside the confidence interval is referred to as \(\alpha\).We wish to construct a (1-\(\alpha\)) confidence interval for the population mean</strong></p>

<p>A (1-\(\alpha\)) confidence interval for the population mean is provided by</p>

<p>\(\hat p\) - \(\lvert z_{\alpha/2} \rvert\) \(\sqrt{(\hat p)(1-\hat p)/n}\) &lt; <strong>p</strong> &lt; \(\hat p\) + \(\lvert z_{\alpha/2} \rvert\) \(\sqrt{(\hat p)(1-\hat p)/n}\)</p>

<p>(1-\(\alpha\)) confidence interval = 98%</p>

<p>\(\alpha\) = 2% and \(\alpha/2\) = 1% or 0.01</p>

<p>The z value corressponding to 0.01 is  which can be obtained in excel with the formula</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>NORM.INV(probability, mean, standard deviation)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>NORM.INV(0.01, 0, 1) = -2.326347874</p>

<p>\(\hat p\) =  0.153846154</p>

<p>\(\lvert z_{\alpha/2} \rvert\) \(\sqrt{(\hat p)(1-\hat p)/n}\) =   0.116396782</p>

<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
 Therefore the <b>90%</b> confidence interval is between  <b>0.037449372</b> and  <b>0.270242936</b>
