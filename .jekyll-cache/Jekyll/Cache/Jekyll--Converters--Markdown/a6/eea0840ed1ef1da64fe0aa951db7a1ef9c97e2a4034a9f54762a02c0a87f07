<p>No matter what \(\mu\) and standard deviation \(\sigma\)  is,</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the area between \(\mu + \sigma\)  and \(\mu - \sigma\) is 68%</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the area between \(\mu + 2\sigma\)  and \(\mu - 2\sigma\) is 95%</p>

  <li>
    <p>the area between \(\mu + 3\sigma\)  and \(\mu - 3\sigma\) is 97%</p>

<h2 id="standard-normal-distribution">Standard Normal Distribution</h2>

<p>The standard normal distribution is characterised by \(\mu\) of <strong>0</strong> and \(\sigma\) is <strong>1</strong>.</p>

<p>All normal distributions can be converted into standard normal distribution by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation.</p>

<p>Z = (X - \(\mu\)) / \(\sigma\)</p>

<p>If Birth weights in a population are normally distributed with a mean of 109 oz and a standard deviation of 13 oz,</p>

<h3 id="question">Question</h3>

<p>What is the chance of having birth weights of <strong>141 oz and higher</strong>  when sampling birth records at random ?</p>

<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>

<p>Z score of 141 = ( 141 - 109)/13 = 2.46</p>

<p>Probability of the weight 141 and lower corresponding to Z score of 2.46 is 0.99305</p>

<p>Probability of the weight 141 and higher 1- 0.99305=.00695 
which is 0.695%</p>

<h3 id="question-1">Question</h3>

<p>What is the chance of having birth weights of <strong>120 oz and lighter</strong>  when sampling birth records at random ?</p>

<h3 id="solution-1">Solution</h3>

<p>Z score of 120 = ( 120 - 109)/13 = 0.846153846</p>

<p>Probability of the weight 120 and lower corresponding to Z score of 0.846153846 is 0.79955  which is around 79.95%</p>

<h2 id="sat-score-example">SAT score example</h2>

<p>For example if we wanted to know the math score that corresponded to the 90th percentile ( assuming a mean score of 500 and standard deviation of 50) ?</p>

<p>In the Z table we would find the Z score corressponding to the probability of 0.9 which would be 1.28.</p>

<p>Z = (X - \(\mu\)) / \(\sigma\)</p>

<p>1.28 = (X - 500)/50</p>

<p>Therefore X = 500 + 50*1.28 = 500 + 64 = 564</p>
