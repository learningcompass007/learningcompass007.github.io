I"›	<p>Binomial Probability distribution has the following characteristics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A fixed number of trials <strong>n</strong>. e.g., 20 coin toss , 40 students</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A binary outcome, a success and a failure. Probability of success is p, probability of failure is 1-p. e.g., head or tail in a coin toss , pass or fail of sttudents in an exam, positive and negative results of a test of a patient.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Constant probability for each trial.e.g., The  probability of a head in each trial is p, the probability of a pass or fail of a student is p1.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="coin-toss-example">Coin Toss Example</h2>

<p>5 coin tosses. What is the probability that there are 3 Heads and 2 Tails ?  This is an example of a <strong>Binomial Probability Distribution</strong>.</p>

<p>Probability of a head is 0.5. One way to get 3 Heads and 2  Tails is HHHTTT. Probability is \({(0.5)}^{5}\). The other ways of having 3 Heads and 2  Tails is provided below.</p>

<p>There are therefore \({5 \choose 3}\) ways of getting 3 heads and 2 tails. Therefore the probability is<br />
\({5 \choose 3}\) * \({(0.5)}^{3} * {(0.5)}^{2}\).</p>

<p>Therefore the probability using <strong>n</strong> trials and getting <strong>X</strong> success is \({n \choose X}\) * \({(p)}^{X} * {(1-p)}^{n-X}\).</p>
