I"x	<p>What is Six Sigma ? How is it related to Statistics ?</p>

<p>To understand this we understand the concepts of</p>
<ul>
  <li>Continuous Random Variable</li>
  <li>Normal distribution</li>
  <li>Standard Normal distribution</li>
</ul>

 Continuous Random Variable
</div>

<p>A <strong>continuous random variable</strong> X is one that can assume an infinite number of values within any given interval. The probability that X falls within any interval is given by the area under the probability distribution (or density function) within that interval.</p>

<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
 Normal Distribution
</div>

<p>The <strong>normal distribution</strong> is a continuous probability distribution and the most commonly used distribution in statistical analysis. The normal curve is <strong>bell-shaped and symmetrical about its mean</strong>. It extends indefinitely in both directions, but most of the area (probability) is clustered around the mean 68.26% of the area (probability) under the normal curve is included within one standard deviation of the mean (i.e., within μ ± 1σ), 95.44% within μ ± 2σ, and 99.74% within μ ± 3σ.</p>

<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
 Standard Normal Distribution
</div>

<p>The <strong>standard normal distribution</strong> is a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 (i.e., μ = 0 and σ = 1). Any normal distribution can be converted into a standard normal distribution by letting μ = 0 and expressing deviations from μ in standard deviation units (z scale).</p>

 Six Sigma (6σ)
</div>

<p><strong>Six Sigma</strong> is a quality-control methodology developed in 1986 by Motorola, Inc. The method uses a data-driven review to limit mistakes or defects in and process. Six Sigma emphasizes cycle-time improvement while at the same time reducing manufacturing defects to a level of no more than 3.4 occurrences per million units or events. In other words, the system is a method to work faster with fewer mistakes.</p>

<p>Six Sigma points to the fact that, mathematically, <strong>it would take a six-standard-deviation event from the mean for an error to happen</strong>. Only 3.4 out of a million randomly (and normally) distributed, events along a bell curve would fall outside of six-standard-deviations.</p>
