I"Ý<p>A t-distribution is like a standard normal (Z) distribution, except it has slightly fatter tails for small samples (n&lt;100).
The bigger the sample size, then closer the t becomes to Z. if nâ‰¥100, t approaches Z.</p>

<ul>
  <li>It is a symmetric distribution centered around zero.</li>
  <li>Has a single parameter called the <strong>degrees of freedom or df.</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="degrees-of-freedom">Degrees of Freedom</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>linked to size of data being used</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>larger set of data would have greater degrees of freedom</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>as degrees of freedom increase the t-distribution becomes closer and closer to the standard normal distribution</p>
  </li>
</ul>
