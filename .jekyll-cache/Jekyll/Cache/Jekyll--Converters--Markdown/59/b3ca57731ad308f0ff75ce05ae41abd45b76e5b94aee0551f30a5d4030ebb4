I"1<p>We would understand the confidence interval calculation through an example when the population standard deviation is not known, but the sample standard deviation is known.</p>

<h2 id="large-drug-store-weekly-sales">Large Drug Store Weekly Sales</h2>

<p>A large drug store wants to estimate average weekly sales for a brand of soap.A random sample of 13 weeks gives the following numbers:123,110,95,120,87,89,100,105,98,88,75,125,101.Give a 90% confidence interval for a weekly basis.</p>

<p><strong>Probability outside the confidence interval is referred to as \(\alpha\).We wish to construct a (1-\(\alpha\)) confidence interval for the population mean</strong></p>

<p>A (1-\(\alpha\)) confidence interval for the population mean is provided by</p>

<p>\(\bar x\) - \(\lvert t_{\alpha/2} \rvert\) s / \(\sqrt{n}\) &lt; \(\mu\) &lt; \(\bar x\) + \(\lvert t_{\alpha/2}\rvert\) s/ \(\sqrt{n}\)</p>

<hr />

<p>We calculate \(\bar x\) = 101.2307692 and s = 15.13359313
and n = 13</p>

<h3 id="90">90%</h3>

<p>(1-\(\alpha\)) confidence interval = 90%</p>

<p>\(\alpha\) = 10% and \(\alpha/2\) = 5% or 0.05</p>

<p>The t value corressponding to 0.05 is -1.9596 which can be obtained in excel with the formula</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>T.INV(probability, degrees of freedom -1)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>T.INV(0.5,13-1) =1.782287556</p>

<p>Therefore 90% confidence interval is between</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>101.2307692 -1.782287556 *15.13359313/ squareroot(13)  =93.74996737</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>101.2307692 +1.782287556 *15.13359313/ squareroot(13) = 108.7115711</p>
  </li>
</ul>
